- 📫 How to reach me -> Rubedoartwork@gmail.com

I once studied 4 semesters of media-computing but due to personal reasons I needed to stop back in 2017. Since then I builded up on my knowledge.
Like you can imagine - Rubedo Artwork is my artist name. Other than programming I'm also drawing digitaly. My published work are mostly manga style artworks but I am capable of designing nearly anything you can imagine.
But another love of mine is writing. I could tell you hours of concepts like storytelling, character arks and symbolism.
My goal is to learn all skills needed to start my career in the IT-business.
